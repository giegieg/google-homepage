From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
Learned how to move divs, reference images from URLs and local sources, align elements, include CSS styles to my page, assign classes and IDs to elements, property utilise specificity hierarchy in CSS, build a search form, apply styles to fonts, and utilise GitHub through Terminal.
